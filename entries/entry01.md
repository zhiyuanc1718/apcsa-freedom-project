## Basic Background

This is the beginning of a year-long project called the **Freedom Project**.
We are given complete freedom :
- our choice of design
- our choice of partnering
- our choice of programming language(s)
- our choice of application (website, app, online game etc)

hence the name "Freedom Project".

## Research Tools

The very first things to do for this project were to figure out **what to make and what tools to use**.
For example,
- If you want **an iOS app**, you should probably spend time looking at **Swift**.
- If you want **android app**, you should look at **Java**.
- If you want **3D games**, then you should check out **Unity**.

## Why **_Swift_** ?

Originally, I wanted to build my own AI bot because I believe [**Halite**](https://halite.io) was interesting for someone who enjoys math.
However, I am also interested in making a game that brings joy, and Halite competition can be something I do on my own rather than
putting it to be the focus of my project.

As an iphone user, I would like to explore Swift and build a game into an iOS app. This means researching about Swift and working
with Xcode. Swift is developed by Apple.inc and that means I can find lots of information on the their [site](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).

## The API & Project Idea

The [**Trivial Database**](https://opentdb.com/) appeals to me because there are lots of different categories and free questions.
I want to use Swift's SpriteKit along with the API to create a fun trivia game. If possible, I would research the possibility of
turning the app into a multiplayer game. Competition and randomness make things fun.
