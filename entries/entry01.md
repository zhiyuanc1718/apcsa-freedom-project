## Basic Background

I am a student enrolled in the Advanced Placement Computer Science A (APCSA) course which focuses on Java.
For our class final project, We are given the freedom to explore a tool and then create a project of our choice.

## Research Tools

The very first things to do for this project were to figure out **what to make**.
For example,
- If you want **an iOS app**, you should probably spend time looking at **Swift**.
- If you want **android app**, you should look at **Java**.
- If you want **3D games**, then you should check out **Unity**.

## Why _Swift_ ?

Originally, I wanted to build my own AI bot because I believe [**Halite**](halite.io) was interesting for someone who enjoys math.
However, I am also interested in making a game that brings joy, and Halite competition can be something I do on my own rather than
putting it to be the focus of my project.

As an iphone user, I would like to explore Swift and build a game into an iOS app. This means researching about Swift and working
with Xcode. Swift is developed by Apple.inc and that means I can find lots of information on the their [site](https://developer.apple.com/swift/).

## The API & Project Idea

The [**Trivial Database**](https://opentdb.com/) appeals to me because there are lots of different categories and free questions.
I want to use Swift's SpriteKit along with the API to create a fun trivia game. If possible, I would research the possibility of
turning the app into a multiplayer game. Competition and randomness make things fun.
